# `pyrff`: Approximating Gaussian Process samples with Random Fourier Features
This project is a Python implementation of random fourier feature (RFF) approximations [1].

It is heavily inspired by the implementations from [2, 3] and generalizes the implementation to work with GP hyperparameters obtained from any GP library.

Examples are given as Jupyter notebooks for GPs fitted with [PyMC3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3) and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org):
